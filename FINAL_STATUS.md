# Task Completed

The language system has been reinforced with strict English default rules.

## Summary of Changes
1.  **AI System Prompts**: Updated to strictly enforce English when `lang="en"`.
2.  **Session Management**: Modified settings to reset language to English on every reload/new session.
3.  **Validation**: Verified correct parameter passing from frontend to backend.

The application is now robust against language "hallucinations" and respects the "English default" requirement.
